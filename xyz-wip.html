				<h3>The Why (Research & the problem statement): </h3>
				<p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0.5rem;">
					<em>Too much information available to Sales force across many different systems and screens.</em>
				</p>
				<p>Our client (name withheld), a leading investment based in New York, needed a next generation system for their
					salespeople.
					A salesperson's job is to interact with the clients and persuade them for more business:in this case,Securities.
					Now
					how do they know which securities to push to the client? This is generally decided by traders and the bank.
					Traders
					and salespeople gather in the morning in the bullpen, where traders tell the salespeople which securities to push
					to
					the client:
					<br />
					<br /> • The salespeople note them on a paper or an excel-sheet and make calls to the clients assigned to them.
					<br /> • Before making the call they go through CRM systems, Bloomberg Terminal, internal spreadsheets, etc. to
					get information
					about the client.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h3>RESEARCH & PERSONA</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<p>Since we had no interaction with the actual users in the beginning, a lot of ideas in the initial concepts
							were based
							on trial and error. Our initial conceptual model of the process and the end user was as follows:
							<br /> • Salespeople are the bridge between a Bank’s client and the traders.
							<br /> • Clients tell them which securities to buy/sell to the traders and vice versa.
							<br /> • Apart from the clients' requests, the bank also pushes securities to pitch based on a proprietary
							algorithm. It
							considers the client's portfolio and other pertinent data points.The end goal is to increase the bank's
							business.
							<br /> • Salespeople and traders usually plan which bonds to push in the morning, with a paper list or an excel
							sheet.
							<br /> • Unlike traders, salespeople are not concerned with live change in prices, but on the bigger picture.
							Salespeople
							are looking for trends and patterns in their client's business behavior. (This was one of the reasons we used
							visualisations
							that show trends e.g. spark-lines).
							<br /> • They don’t use mobile phones or tablets to access the system (only desktop experience).

				<h3>REFINED USER PERSONAS AND WORKFLOWS</h3>
				<p style="font-weight:800;margin-bottom:0.5rem;">
					<em>Instead of following the standard persona template, we concentrated on task analysis as there is no specified age group for salespeople, and since the tasks they hand are quite specific, their end goals are more or less the same.</em>
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p> •  Sales people usually get into the office at about 7–7:30am and finish by 4:30–5:00pm.
					<br/>
					•  Start the day with a meeting with traders. The traders walk them through the securities on focus for the day.
					<br/>
					•  The sales people may start with the security or a client may call them over the phone inquiring about a certain security. At times a trader or another sales person may also tell them to focus on a security.
					<br/>
					•  A lot of communication happens verbally within the office. Everyone sits within a earshot distance.
					<br/>
					•  Usually about 20–25 clients are assigned to a sales person’s ‘book.’
					<br/>
					•  Prices are not firm and are not always frequently updated. Sales people may ask the trader before making an offer to the client. It may also depend on geographies. 
					<br/>
					•  Sales people may follow up with a trader, if an e-inquiry by one of their clients is not being executed.
					<br/>
					•  The layout of the application must be highly customizable as each trader may have unique tab structures.
					<br/>
					•  They only work from the office, and don’t take any work home.
					<br/>
					•  They don’t use mobile or tablets.</p>

					<h4>User Flow 1 (Security Driven): </h4>
					<p> 	
						•  Trader defines securities in focus at the start of the day.
						<br/>	•  The system ranks these securities based on a weightage. The weightage is combination of client portfolio, holdings, and recent transactions.
						<br/>	•  Sales people usually start at the top of the list by selecting a security.
						<br/>	•  Security matches according to recent client transactions are displayed, along with market activity, live prices, client list, trade history, new issue history, portfolio match and feedback matches are displayed.
						<br/>	•  To get more information about a security, salesperson may get in touch with the trader through phone or IB chat (Bloomberg Terminal).
						<br/>	•  The sales person calls or communicates over a chat with the client.
						<br/>	•  If the client agrees to a trade, a ticket is raised and sent to the trader, who then executes the trade.
						<br/>	•  If the client is not interested, then a manual feedback is submitted. Feedback is categorized under buy, sell, hold and info. Info is kind of a catch all. 
						<br/>	•  When the client does not agree to a trade, there is an still an opportunity to obtain information about the client’s view on that security or market in general. This data is not being captured systematically today.	
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
					<h4>User Flow 2(Client Driven):	</h4>
					<br/>
					<p> 	
							•  A list of focus clients is displayed. This list is ordered by a combination of factors — revenue, recent transactions, hit ratio, and current holdings.
						<br/>	•  Selecting a client will reveal a list of securities that the client may be interested in.
						<br/>	•  Associated with each security there may be the bank’s price, market price, aggregate views of Flow (trade, e-inquiries, feedback, and orders/quotes.), and holdings.
						<br/>	•  The sales person calls or communicates over a chat with the client. 
						<br/>	•  Sales person has the option to present multiple securities to the client.
						<br/>	•  If the client agrees to a trade, a ticket is raised and sent to the trader, who then executes the trade.
						<br/>	•  If the client is not interested, then a manual feedback is submitted. Feedback is categorized under buy, sell, hold and info. Info is kind of a catch all. 
						<br/>	•  When the client does not agree to the trade, there is an still an opportunity to obtain information about the client’s view on that security or market in general. This data is not being captured systematically today.
						<br/>	•  What happens when a sales person is done with a particular client? Do they move to the next client? Can we mark the client ‘done’ like in an email?		
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
					<h4>User Flow 3 (Free Search):</h4>
					<br/>
					<p> 	
							•  If a salesperson (a) does not see a client or axe to click in their list, or (b) wishes to quickly search for either, they may enter a free-search.
							<br/>
							Free-search may be used when:
							<br/>•  A client calls the salesperson with an inquiry
							<br/>•  A trader has directed them verbally to focus on a specific security
							<br/>•  Results of the free-search are displayed contextually, co-mingling security and client-data
							<br/>•  The workflow switches to either Security or Client mode, depending on what the salesperson selects

					<p>The app is currently in closed alpha stage right now. Based on client feedback, we refined the main flow by
						removing
						non-essential elements.One of the lessons learned during the span of the project was the rapid penetration of the
						smartphones
						in the rural and remote parts of India. This upcoming segment requires interfaces which are less text driven.
